  abstract =	 "Due to significant changes in agro-ecological
                  contexts, farmers need new solutions to produce
                  goods. Modelling complements field experiments in
                  the design of new farming systems. French
                  researchers involved in such design issues developed
                  a specific modelling platform to help model,
                  simulate and evaluate cropping systems. After
                  testing several existing environments, the RECORD
                  platform was developed under the VLE environment,
                  allowing the design of atomic and coupled models. It
                  integrates different time steps and spatial scales
                  and proposes some standard formalisms used to model
                  agro-ecosystems (e.g. difference equations,
                  differential equations, state charts…). A graphic
                  user interface was designed to simplify coding
                  tasks.  A variety of research projects already use
                  this platform. Examples are given showing the
                  ability to recode simple models, encapsulate more
                  complex models, link with GIS and databases, and use
                  the R statistical package to run models and analyse
                  simulation outputs. The option to use web interfaces
                  enables application by non-scientist end-users. As
                  the models follow a given standard, they can be
                  placed in a repository and used by other
                  researchers. Linking RECORD to other international
                  platforms is now a compelling issue."
